# Demystifying AI/ML/DL

# Module 1: What is Artificial Intelligence
* AI is intelligence behavior by machine
* Machine-based intelligence (AI) can mimics cognitive human functions
* Knowledge Engineering: key component of AI research
  * Knowledge + Software Programs = Decisions
* Modelling process: feeding data into software programs and coming up with a like-human decision
  * Model: software algorithms
* Why is AI important?
  * Product enhancements add features
  * New user experience New Markets
  * Disruption
* Example: fraud detection, chatbot
* AI/ML/DL

* Machine Learning
  * Data -> Processing with algorithms -> Predictions

  * ML can do: make prediction, optimize utility functions, extract hidden data structures, classify data
* Deep Learning
  * Using artificial neural network
  * Deep learning recognizes features on its own
* How to Establish an Effective AI Strategy
  * Fast computing environments
  * Ubiquitous data
  * Advanced learning algorithms
* The Flywheel of Data: more data -> better analytics -> better products -> more users -> more data
* AI at Amazon
  * Discovery and search
  * Fulfillment and logistics
  * Enhancing existing products
  * Defining new product categories
  * Bringing machine learning to all
* AI layers on AWS
  * Services: Rekognition (Vision), Polly (Speech), Lex (Chat)
  * Platforms: Amazon ML, Spark & EMR, Kinesis, Batch, ECS
  * Engines: TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Theano, MXNet, Caffe, CNTK
  * Infrastructures: GPU, CPU, IoT, Mobile
