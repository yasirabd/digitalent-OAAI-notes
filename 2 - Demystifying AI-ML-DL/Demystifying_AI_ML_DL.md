# Demystifying AI/ML/DL

# Module 1: What is Artificial Intelligence
* AI is intelligence behavior by machine
* Machine-based intelligence (AI) can mimics cognitive human functions
* Knowledge Engineering: key component of AI research
  * Knowledge + Software Programs = Decisions
* Modelling process: feeding data into software programs and coming up with a like-human decision
  * Model: software algorithms
* Why is AI important?
  * Product enhancements add features
  * New user experience New Markets
  * Disruption
* Example: fraud detection, chatbot
* AI/ML/DL

* Machine Learning
  * Data -> Processing with algorithms -> Predictions
  Image
  * ML can do: make prediction, optimize utility functions, extract hidden data structures, classify data
* Deep Learning
  * Using artificial neural network
  * Deep learning recognizes features on its own
* How to Establish an Effective AI Strategy
  * Fast computing environments
  * Ubiquitous data
  * Advanced learning algorithms
* The Flywheel of Data: more data -> better analytics -> better products -> more users -> more data
* AI at Amazon
  * Discovery and search
  * Fulfillment and logistics
  * Enhancing existing products
  * Defining new product categories
  * Bringing machine learning to all
* AI layers on AWS
  * Services: Rekognition (Vision), Polly (Speech), Lex (Chat)
  * Platforms: Amazon ML, Spark & EMR, Kinesis, Batch, ECS
  * Engines: TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Theano, MXNet, Caffe, CNTK
  * Infrastructures: GPU, CPU, IoT, Mobile

## Module 2: What is Machine Learning
* ML Use Cases
  * Fraud Detection: Mine data -> Identify pattern and create labels -> train model -> flag transaction as fraudulent
  * Content Personalization: use predictive analytics models to recommend items
  * Targeted marketing: use prior customer activity to choose the most relevant email campaigns for target customers
  * Categorization: Unstructured content -> ML model -> structured documents
  * Customer service: analyze social media traffic to route customers to customer care specialists
* ML Concepts
  * Predict
  * Extract
  * Summarize
  * Optimize
  * Adapt
* Types of Machine Learning Problems
Image
  * Supervised: teaches the model by providing a dataset with inputs and outputs
  * Unsupervised: no external teacher or pre-trained data
  * Reinforcement: Input -> agent -> action -> reward feedback to agent
* ML and Smart Applications
  * Challenges: expertise, scaling, time to operationalize
* ML Platforms on AWS
  * Amazon ML
  * Amazon EMR
  * Spark and SparkML
* Building Smart Applications with Amazon ML: train model -> evaluate and optimize -> retrieve predictions
