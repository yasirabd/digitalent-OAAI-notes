# Demystifying AI/ML/DL

# Module 1: What is Artificial Intelligence
* AI is intelligence behavior by machine
* Machine-based intelligence (AI) can mimics cognitive human functions
* Knowledge Engineering: key component of AI research
  * Knowledge + Software Programs = Decisions
* Modelling process: feeding data into software programs and coming up with a like-human decision
  * Model: software algorithms
* Why is AI important?
  * Product enhancements add features
  * New user experience New Markets
  * Disruption
* Example: fraud detection, chatbot
* AI/ML/DL

* Machine Learning
  * Data -> Processing with algorithms -> Predictions

  * ML can do: make prediction, optimize utility functions, extract hidden data structures, classify data
* Deep Learning
  * Using artificial neural network
  * Deep learning recognizes features on its own
* How to Establish an Effective AI Strategy
  * Fast computing environments
  * Ubiquitous data
  * Advanced learning algorithms
* The Flywheel of Data: more data -> better analytics -> better products -> more users -> more data
* AI at Amazon
  * Discovery and search
  * Fulfillment and logistics
  * Enhancing existing products
  * Defining new product categories
  * Bringing machine learning to all
* AI layers on AWS
  * Services: Rekognition (Vision), Polly (Speech), Lex (Chat)
  * Platforms: Amazon ML, Spark & EMR, Kinesis, Batch, ECS
  * Engines: TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Theano, MXNet, Caffe, CNTK
  * Infrastructures: GPU, CPU, IoT, Mobile

## Module 2: What is Machine Learning
* ML Use Cases
  * Fraud Detection: Mine data -> Identify pattern and create labels -> train model -> flag transaction as fraudulent
  * Content Personalization: use predictive analytics models to recommend items
  * Targeted marketing: use prior customer activity to choose the most relevant email campaigns for target customers
  * Categorization: Unstructured content -> ML model -> structured documents
  * Customer service: analyze social media traffic to route customers to customer care specialists
* ML Concepts
  * Predict
  * Extract
  * Summarize
  * Optimize
  * Adapt
* Types of Machine Learning Problems
![types machine learning](https://github.com/yasirabd/digitalent-OAAI-notes/blob/master/assets/ml-types.PNG "Types of Machine Learning")
  * Supervised: teaches the model by providing a dataset with inputs and outputs
  * Unsupervised: no external teacher or pre-trained data
  * Reinforcement: Input -> agent -> action -> reward feedback to agent
* ML and Smart Applications
  * Challenges: expertise, scaling, time to operationalize
* ML Platforms on AWS
  * Amazon ML
  * Amazon EMR
  * Spark and SparkML
* Building Smart Applications with Amazon ML: train model -> evaluate and optimize -> retrieve predictions

## Module 3: What is Deep Learning
* Learns tasks using artificial neural network (ANN)
* Uses many layers of non-linear processing units
* These layers handle different parts of data processing
* What is NN?
  * a set of simple mathematical functions that can trained to collectively learn complex functions.
  * Input layer -> Hidden layers -> Output layer
  * A Node: activation(weight . input (x) + bias)
  * Types of NN: Feedforward, recurrent
* Industry domains
  * Text analysis
  * Time series/predictive analysis
  * Sound analysis
  * Image analysis
* Challenge for NN: SCALE
* Deep Learning on AWS
  * Amazon Lex (conversational engine)
  * Amazon Polly (lifelike speech)
  * Amazon Rekognition (image analysis)
* DIY: AWS Deep Learning AMIs
  * Benefits: easy setup, hassle-free configurations, pay for what you use
  * Getting started: One-click deploy, Launch AWS CloudFormation template
